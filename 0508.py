Project 508: Asset Price Bubble Detection
Description:
Asset price bubbles occur when the price of an asset exceeds its intrinsic value, often driven by speculation, leading to a crash when the bubble bursts. Detecting these bubbles early can help investors avoid significant losses. In this project, we will use a simple model based on price-to-earnings ratios (P/E ratio), historical price trends, and moving averages to detect potential asset bubbles.

🧪 Python Implementation (Asset Price Bubble Detection using Moving Averages and P/E Ratio)
For real-world applications:

Use data from real financial markets or specific assets like real estate, stocks, or cryptocurrencies.

Implement more advanced techniques like machine learning or market indicators to improve bubble detection accuracy.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
# 1. Download stock data (e.g., Apple stock) to analyze potential bubbles
stock_data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2015-01-01", end="2021-01-01")['Close']
 
# 2. Calculate moving averages (50-day and 200-day moving averages)
short_window = 50
long_window = 200
stock_data['SMA50'] = stock_data.rolling(window=short_window).mean()
stock_data['SMA200'] = stock_data.rolling(window=long_window).mean()
 
# 3. Detect potential bubbles using price deviation from the long-term average
stock_data['Price_Deviation'] = stock_data['Close'] / stock_data['SMA200']
 
# Define a threshold for identifying a bubble (e.g., price is 20% above the 200-day moving average)
threshold = 1.2  # Price deviating 20% above the SMA200 might signal a bubble
stock_data['Bubble_Detection'] = np.where(stock_data['Price_Deviation'] > threshold, 1, 0)
 
# 4. Plot the price data, moving averages, and bubble detection signals
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
 
# Plot stock price and moving averages
plt.plot(stock_data['Close'], label="Stock Price (AAPL)", color='blue')
plt.plot(stock_data['SMA50'], label="50-Day Moving Average", color='orange', linestyle='--')
plt.plot(stock_data['SMA200'], label="200-Day Moving Average", color='green', linestyle='--')
 
# Highlight bubble detection signals
plt.scatter(stock_data.index[stock_data['Bubble_Detection'] == 1], stock_data['Close'][stock_data['Bubble_Detection'] == 1], 
            marker='o', color='red', label='Potential Bubble')
 
# Title and labels
plt.title("Asset Price Bubble Detection (AAPL Stock)")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Price (USD)")
plt.legend(loc="best")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
 
# 5. Output the periods with detected bubbles
bubble_dates = stock_data[stock_data['Bubble_Detection'] == 1].index
print("Detected Potential Bubbles in Asset Price:\n")
print(bubble_dates)
✅ What It Does:
Downloads stock price data (Apple stock in this case) and calculates 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

Detects potential asset price bubbles based on how much the price deviates from the long-term moving average (using a threshold of 20% above the 200-day moving average).

Visualizes the stock price, moving averages, and bubble detection signals.

Identifies periods where the price exceeds the set threshold (indicating potential bubbles).

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use real-world data: Apply the bubble detection model to other asset classes like real estate, commodities, or cryptocurrencies.

Advanced methods: Implement more complex models like machine learning or time-series analysis to detect bubbles based on multiple features such as P/E ratio, market sentiment, and economic conditions.

Different bubble indicators: Combine Bollinger Bands, momentum indicators, and economic data to improve bubble detection accuracy.
